Run these commands from the project root in order. Stop and report any failures before proceeding.

## 1. Type-check

```bash
cargo check
```

This is the fastest way to detect compilation errors. Run this first.

## 2. Lint

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
```

Warnings are treated as errors. If clippy reports any, fix them before continuing.

## 3. Format

```bash
cargo fmt --all
```

Ensure all files are formatted. If the command makes changes, re-run step 1 and 2.

## 4. Test

```bash
cargo test
```

Run all unit and integration tests.

## 5. Release build (optional)

Only when the user explicitly asks for a release build:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Common issues

- **`link.exe not found`**: Ensure Visual Studio build tools or LLVM/clang are installed.
- **`ninja not found`**: Install via `choco install ninja` or ensure it's on PATH.
- **Skia linking errors**: The `skia-safe` crate bundles pre-built binaries; a network connection may be needed on first build.
